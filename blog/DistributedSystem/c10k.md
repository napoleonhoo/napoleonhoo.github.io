# C10K

> The C10k problem is the problem of optimising network sockets to handle a large number of clients at the same time. The name C10k is a numeronym for concurrently handling ten thousand connections.

翻译：并发处理10K个连接。

> Note that concurrent connections are not the same as requests per second, though they are similar: handling many requests per second requires high throughput (processing them quickly), while a high number of concurrent connections requires efficient scheduling of connections. In other words, handling many requests per second is concerned with the speed of handling requests, whereas a system capable of handling a high number of concurrent connections does not necessarily have to be a fast system, only one where each request will deterministically return a response within a (not necessarily fixed) finite amount of time.

翻译：并发连接和每秒请求数不一样。每秒处理大量的请求需要高吞吐量（处理速度快）；大量的并发连接需要高效调度连接。所以，一个可以高并发的系统不一定快，只需要在有限的时间内返回响应即可。

> The problem of socket server optimisation has been studied because a number of factors must be considered to allow a web server to support many clients. This can involve a combination of operating system constraints and web server software limitations. According to the scope of services to be made available and the capabilities of the operating system as well as hardware considerations such as multi-processing capabilities, a multi-threading model or a single threading model can be preferred. Concurrently with this aspect, which involves considerations regarding memory management (usually operating system related), strategies implied relate to the very diverse aspects of the I/O management.
Nginx was created to solve C10K problem.

当然，现在我们早已经突破了 C10K 这个瓶颈，具体的思路就是通过单个进程或线程服务于多个客户端请求，通过异步编程和事件触发机制替换轮训，IO 采用非阻塞的方式，减少不必要的性能损耗，等等。

底层的相关技术包括 epoll、kqueue、libevent 等，应用层面的解决方案包括 OpenResty、Golang、Node.js 等，比如 OpenResty 的介绍中是这么说的：

OpenResty 通过汇聚各种设计精良的 Nginx 模块，从而将 Nginx 有效地变成一个强大的通用 Web 应用平台。这样，Web 开发人员和系统工程师可以使用 Lua 脚本语言调动 Nginx 支持的各种 C 以及 Lua 模块，快速构造出足以胜任 C10K 乃至 C1000K 以上单机并发连接的高性能 Web 应用系统。
