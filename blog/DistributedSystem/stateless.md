# Stateless & Statefull

reference: [Stateless vs Stateful Servers (with examples)](https://medium.com/@cfqbcgwkg/stateless-vs-stateful-servers-with-examples-6e37223c028f)

> Stateless Servers
> 
> A stateless server, like a web server, does not retain any information on the state of its clients.
> 
> Soft State
> 
> A particular form of stateless design is where the server maintains soft state on behalf of the client for a limited time.
> 
> Stateful Servers
> 
> In contrast, a stateful server retains persistent information on its clients.

1. Stateless：不保存client的信息。
2. Soft State：保存client信息一段时间。
3. Stateful：一直保存client信息。
